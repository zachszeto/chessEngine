# chessEngine
This project aims to construct a C-based chess engine employing bitboards, bit manipulation, and efficient move generation techniques. It will incorporate Alpha-Beta Pruning and Iterative Deepening for optimized search processes, a Principal Variation Table for storing best moves, and Lazy SMP for efficient multi-core processing to enhance evaluation and search speed.
