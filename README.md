# :chess_pawn: ChessEngine :chess_pawn:
In this project, I aim to create a chess engine using C, focusing on learning and implementing techniques like bitboards, bit manipulation, and efficient move generation. Bitboards will be employed to represent the chessboard and pieces, optimizing move generation and evaluation processes.

To enhance the engine's search efficiency, I will implement Alpha-Beta Pruning which will significantly reduce the search space. Iterative Deepening will further improve search accuracy by exploring the game tree at increasing depths.

For move ordering and improved performance, I will learn about and use a Principal Variation Table to store and access the best moves during search. Additionally, Null Move Pruning will be used to reduce unnecessary exploration.

To improve our runtime and efficiency, I'll use  utilize Lazy SMP, allowing our chess engine to efficiently search and evaluate multiple positions concurrently.

Throughout the project I hope to learn the nuances to C programming, implementing various data structures and algorithms essential for chess engines. By the end, we'll have a fully functional chess engine that showcases the application of what I have learned.
